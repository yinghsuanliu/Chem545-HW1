# Chem545-HW1
To submit Chem545 HW1
This repository contains the code for solving the problems in the assignment, including two main Python functions:
1. `extract_parameter`: A function to parse and extract components from a given parameter string.
2. `calculate_solution_weights`: A function to calculate the weights of chemical compounds required for a given solution.


For problem 1:
1. idntify the "Invalid input" with if code
2. retrieve the list of parameter values
3. Check if the index is out of range
4. Retrieve the value based on the given index
5. Return the formatted string

to run Problem 1:
python extract_parameter.py

For problem 2:
1. Check if the format is valid and split the chemical and 
concertration
2. Remove 'M' and convert to float
3. Calculate solutions

to run Problem 2:
python calculate_solution_weights.py
